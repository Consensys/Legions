## TODO:
  - [x] Able to connect to ws / http / https / IPC
  - [ ] Fix `Verbose` Status bar (It does not change from `OFF`)
  - [ ] Print Accounts in `getnodeinfo` in a pretty format (One per line)
  - [x] A way to reinitiate w3 (web3) by setting it to new host (right now it works for sethost but getnodeinfo still uses the first initiated w3)
  - [ ] add way more functionalities
  - [x] `chains.json` depending on the execution path might not be found. fix it.
  - [ ] inline TODOs (tons)
